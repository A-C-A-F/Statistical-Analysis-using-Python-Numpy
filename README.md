# Statistical-Analysis-using-Python-Numpy

The data set that we're going to work with is a dataset from Kaggle, Student Performance Dataset.

__Data Source:__ *https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/barkhaverma/student-performance-dataset*

### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Create an Adjacency List using a Python Dictionary where each entry is a List. 
2.	Add the Python function to find the shortest paths to each vertex from the source vertex. 
3.	Add the function to populate the adjacency list of edges from a file using a Python Dictionary container.

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Analyze the T-Test problem and use the Python Pandas to read from the CSV into a Data Frame.
- __Task 2:__ Obtain two Numpy arrays from the DataFrame column to represent Female student scores and Male Student scores.
- __Task 3:__ Compute the variance of the two arrays using the standard deviation from each array.
- __Task 4:__ Add the Numpy code to compute the pooled Variance and standard deviation and determine the T-value and P-value of the data sets.
- __Task 5:__ Add a function to remove outliers from each set of data, then re-compute the T-value and P-value.
